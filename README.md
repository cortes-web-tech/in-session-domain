# inSession

## An open source presentation management solution [Demo](https://inSessionEvent.com)

- Built on LAMP
- ReactJS Front end
- Customizable databases using MariaDB & MySQL
- Hosted on AWS EC2
- This read me isn't where the main project file is stored. It's in [react-is](/react-is/).
- This directory is more of a container for different iterations of the project.
- You can disregard the PHP files from the root directory for now.

  **inSession was made as an open source project and is not intended for commercial use.**
